# Sample-_SuperStore_dashboard
This repository contains my first Power BI dashboard project, Sample Superstore. The dashboard provides insights into sales, profit, and customer trends using interactive visualizations.

## (KPI) Questions
### The dashboard answers the following business questions:

1. What is the total sales revenue, profit, and quantity sold?
2. Which states contribute the most to sales and profitability?
3. How has profit changed over the years and across different quarters?
4. Which product categories and sub-categories are the most profitable?
5. Which customer segments generate the highest profit margins?
6. Which geographical region is the most profitable?
